## Description of contents

**clustering_documents**
This very much a work in progress. An attempt to use a kmeans clustering algorithm on parts of the OB corpus

**tf-idf**
Contains a notebook which can pass a multiword search query (in regex patterns) on any amount of the OB corpus.
It calculates some basic statistics for word frequencies and finally computes tf-idf for the search terms in the retrieved documents (this is still to be completed).

The Code is written by Soeren Fomsgaard and Stella Verkijk.

**speech**
Quirine Smit's work on speech extraction and gender-identification?


***occupation***
Vivian Claes' code for extracting occupations (pre- and post-1834), accounting for the change in formatting. Sparql script (found in txt file) works better than the XML code.
